# Progress Log

## 2026-01-22 - Fix mobile hero preview (Issue #70)

### Task Completed
- Implemented mobile-specific hero preview layout showing 4 full-width previews in a column
- Desktop continues to show 8 previews in a flex wrap layout
- Mobile arrow-down indicator now scrolls to the mobile previews section instead of infinite grid

### Key Decisions
- Used separate render paths for mobile (lg:hidden) and desktop (hidden lg:flex)
- Mobile previews use 400px render size scaled via CSS to fill width
- Added mobilePreviewsRef prop to allow parent component to control scroll target

### Files Changed
- apps/app/src/components/AlgorithmHero/index.tsx - Added mobile layout with 4 full-width previews
- apps/app/src/components/AlgorithmHero/AlgorithmHeroSkeleton.tsx - Updated skeleton to match mobile layout
- apps/app/src/routes/a.$algorithmId.tsx - Added scroll handler for mobile previews

### Notes
- Pre-existing TypeScript errors in codebase unrelated to this change
- Build environment has rollup module issues (pre-existing)

## 2026-01-27 - Disconnect local file on post (Issue #78)

### Task Completed
- Local file connection is now disconnected when user posts their algorithm from the /create page
- Ensures users start with a clean slate when returning to the create feature

### Key Decisions
- Called disconnect() from useLocalFile hook in PostButton's onSuccess callback
- Disconnect happens before clearing the algorithm name and navigating away

### Files Changed
- apps/app/src/features/create/PostButton.tsx - Import useLocalFile hook and call disconnectLocalFile() on successful post

### Notes
- Pre-existing TypeScript errors and build issues still present (not related to this change)
